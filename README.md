# Cantilever Beam Deflection Analysis Under Variable Point Loads

The deflection of a beam is the amount that the beam bends or sags under a load. The deflection of a cantilever beam, which is a beam that is fixed at one end and free at the other, can be calculated using the following equation:

δ = (PL^3)/(3EI)

Where:
δ is the deflection of the beam
P is the point load acting on the beam
L is the length of the beam
E is the modulus of elasticity of the beam's material
I is the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-sectional area
The moment of inertia (I) is a measure of a beam's resistance to bending, and it is calculated based on the beam's cross-sectional area (A) and the distance of the material from the neutral axis (y):

I = A*y^2

The modulus of elasticity (E) is a measure of the material's stiffness, and it is calculated based on the material's stress-strain behavior.
Keep in mind that this is a simplified equation and that it only applies to a cantilever beam under a point load. The equation will be different if you have more complex loading conditions, such as a distributed load or a combination of point and distributed load.
Also, note that this equation is only valid for small deflection, linear elastic condition. Also, this equation assumes that the material is isotropic and linear elastic.
